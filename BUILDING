this is mostly compatible with 
gnu/linux systems, but if you
want to try it under windows with
WSL or cygwin, be my guest!


requirements
------------

* gnu make
* hope you have the libc 
  headers at least...


building
--------
a simple
	
	make clean all

would do the trick and an executable
will pop up in the folder.
for more cleaning
	
	make distclean

would solve all your problems :)
